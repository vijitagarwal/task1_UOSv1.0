## 🚀 The Vision
Global Odyssey is a high-performance travel and tourism portal built to demonstrate the transition from local development to professional cloud-native engineering. 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Workflow
This project was developed using a "Linux-First" mindset:
- **Environment:** Developed on **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL/Ubuntu)**.
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Modular Architecture), Bootstrap 5.
- **Version Control:** Git with SSH authentication.
- **CI/CD:** Automated pipeline via **GitHub to Vercel** (Continuous Deployment).

## 🛡️ Security & Architecture
As a Cybersecurity minor, I implemented several industry standards:
- **Modular CSS:** Separation of `global.css` and page-specific styles for performance.
- **Security Disclosure:** Implementation of `security.txt` (RFC 9116) for vulnerability reporting.
- **Asset Optimization:** Standardized naming conventions and directory flattening for faster builds.
